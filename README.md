# Lasso-ML: Machine Learning Code for Stroke Study

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning code focused on a stroke study using Lasso regression techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and statistical analysis.

## Contents
- `externalTest.ipynb`: Code for external testing of the model.
- `fillDropThings.py`: Script for data preprocessing tasks,filling the missing data by RF.
- `lasso_ml.ipynb`: Main notebook implementing Lasso regression, model constructing and SHAP analysis.
- `lasso_ml_cross_validation.ipynb`: Notebook for performing 5 fold cross-validation version of lasso_ml.

- `statistics_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for statistical analysis of the results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation
